# Kalberer Lights

What happens when the **sights and sounds of Christmas** (the best holiday) meet **electronics and embedded computing**?
The answer is Kalberer Lights, an ongoing digital/electrical/high-tech Christmas Lights display powered by a fleet of Raspberry Pi computers, relays and timings, old-fashioned C7 and C9 incandescent bulbs, electricity, and dedication. Each year, I capture a video showcasing the best views from the display, which has been consistently expanding each year.

## Tech Stuff

This display is powered by three Raspberry Pi computers, two Pi 3 Bs and one Pi 2. They are networked together via WiFi and running a custom open-source operating system design for holiday lighting called "Falcon" (or "Falcon Player"). Sequences (the timings of the lights to music) are either created or adapted from other Christmas light DIYers using the XLights for Windows software.

**NOTE:** Kalberer Lights is not for profit and no copyright infringement is intended when using popular Christmas songs for this display.
