# Forensic Analysis of Xbox Series consoles

Most Xbox users are aware by now that the new fleet of Xbox consoles (Series S and Series X) are essentially purpose-built gaming PCs. In fact, the Xbox consoles run a modified version of Windows 10 that has had the Win32 application frameworks removed. This means they only run "Modern Windows Apps" (UWP, WPF), but the underlying Windows operating system is the same. Since we can do forensic analysis of a Windows 10 PC, can we do forensics on an Xbox?
Goal: Extract forensic artifacts from an Xbox Series S console **without** removing the SSD.
## More to come.
